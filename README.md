# Blue Mountain Project Prototypes

This project is an set of wireframes for [Blue Mountain Project](http://bluemountain.princeton.edu/index.html) screens.  Rather than create wireframes and mockups in Photoshop or Balsamiq, I opted to create them directly in HTML.  With pattern libraries and styleguide frameworks like Bootstrap and [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/prototyping.html), [directly prototyping in HTML](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/rapidly-prototype-websites) is not only possible, but faster and more effective than the tools of the past. Furthermore, the artifacts are "shovel ready" and able to be used in an interactive prototype, or even as a base for the project itself.
