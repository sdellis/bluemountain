                            <p>Founded in 1921, the first volume of Broom was a joint editorial project between <a href="">Alfred Kreymborg</a> (poet and previously editor of Others) and <a href="">Harold Loeb</a> (American writer and expat living in), with <a href="">Giuseppe Prezzolini</a> (an Italian literary critic) functioning as associate editor. Kreymborg left after the first volume (because of editorial differences), and the following two issues were edited solely by Loeb before he was joined by Edward Storer as associate editor and Lola Ridge as American editor, who were, in turn, later replaced by Slater Browne, Malcolm Cowley and Matthew Josephson as associate editors.</p>

                            With headquarters in Rome, a New York office (run for most party by Lola Ridge) and a London distributing office, Broom was an 'international magazine of the arts' par excellence that published �migr�s, as well as local and internationally-based artists and writers. As a little magazine that has become crucial in our understanding of the American avant-garde and its connections to the continental European Dada and Surrealist groups, it published modernists like Apollinaire, Williams, Pound, Stein, Moore, Lowell, Cendrars, Cummings, Aiken, Jean Toomer, Hart Crane, Stevens, Virginia Woolf and visual artists Sheeler, Matisse, Moholy-Nagy, Picasso, dadaists Elsa von Freitag-Loringhoven, Hans Arp, Man Ray, surrealists Jean Cocteau and Soupault, German expressionist/surrealist Paul Klee, as well as less well-known but important figures such as John Rodker, Kay Boyle, Yvor Winters, and Lola Ridge. But the magazine also had a more traditional or historical streak: it reprinted 18th century lithographs (by Lautreamont) and costume designs and translated work by Dostoyevsky -thereby combining the contemporary with the old. 
                            
                            Broom's long run compared to other little magazines (twenty-one issues overall) ensured the presence of a broad and numerous spectrum of contributors, which, in turn, made the magazine less representative of a local and aesthetically or politically coherent group, unlike for instance, 291, Dada, and Others.
                            
                            The magazine's connections to Dada, Surrealism and Futurism are proudly demonstrated on its covers, which were designed by, respectively, the Italian futurist Enrico Prampolini, the French cubist painter Fernand Leger, the Russian avant-garde artists Natalia Goncharova and El Lissitzky, Spanish cubist Juan Gris, or the Dadaist/Surrealist Man Ray, amongst others. And yet, the inclusion of Dada contributions did not have radical formal consequences for Broom's layout, design, and content, and the magazine remained attached to the formal conventions of the Victorian magazine form. 
                            
                            Although the typeface changed slightly with each new printer in Rome, Berlin, and New York, Broom's typography and layout were fairly traditional. Using a font based on the Century type family-which is known for its excellent legibility and created for mass magazine)-already speaks (structurally and visually on the level of the page) to the magazine's emphasis on content rather than radically experimental design and subversive presentation. This traditionalism or elegance in design rather than subversion of conventions or shock prevailed also in the choice of paper: the Italian printer used paper with chain lines and paper-marks, marks that would be read as proof of the quality of paper as laid paper, rather than machine-made paper. 
                            
                            By virtue of its editorial outposts and the editorial and distributing locations Broom was more international than other magazines (that emphasised an explicitly American avant-garde) in scope and reach (whether in original contributions or translations).
                            
                            The magazine published poems, prose, reviews, translations, and important essays on Russian constructivism, on machine art and the machine age, and on photography. Translations featured heavily, and more emphatically than in other magazines-another example of Broom's international outlook. Broom contained drawings (once even in colour), illustrations, and photographs, the amount/presence of which decreased rapidly as the magazine moved to New York, while sponsored advertising increased from vol. II on (vol. I manages entirely without ads)- another correlative of the increasingly difficult financing of the magazine. The size of the magazine usually varied between W:22cm; L:33cm, with the last six issues being visibly decreased in size (W: 19.5cm; L: 27cm), correlating with the move to New York and therefore a new printer, but possibly also with a new financial situation which also affected the amount of content (initially 100 pages long, the last issues vary between 76 and 52 pages).
                            
                            Notices range from sponsored advertisements for clothes, to publication and subscription notices. Broom, for instance, offered deals of joint purchase of modernist books, like Woolf's Jacob's Room and the latest issue of Broom, amongst others.
                            
                            From vol. V Broom also became a small press ('The Broom Publishing Company, Inc.') and published books under its imprint, such as The Poet Assassinated: A Novel, by Apollinaire (translated by Matthew Josephson). This publishing practice puts it in the good company of other little magazines such as Glebe and Dada (Au Sans Pareil) which also published chapbooks of their contributors.
                            
                            Broom had no clearly defined or outlined editorial programme, the masthead of the first issue however, promises to make room for both artists with an already existing reputation as well 'the unknown, path-breaking artist will have, when his material merits it'. With its logo and motto of the 'broom' (often in the form of a cartoonish man dancing with a broom on the back cover), the magazine prides itself on its sweeping away of hindrances for the creation of artistic interaction: 'Broom is a sort of clearing house where the artists of the present time will be brought into closer contact.' Another uniting feature especially of the young American contributors, according to Loeb, was their 'whole-hearted disapproval of the generation that preceded them' (Loeb, 'Comment-Broom: 1921-1923', Broom, 5.1, p. 56), and Broom's later volumes champion American modernists of 'the new generation', slightly delayed, after initial scepticism (the first issue of Broom showed itself rather critical of the political left of American poetry as represented in magazines like The Little Review and Contact). Despite the care it took with its covers, Broom was emphatically a non-commercial little magazine that did not choose contributions based on commercial value, but as the magazine repeatedly stated also welcomed work that was not yet 'mature' or work by less-well-known writers.
